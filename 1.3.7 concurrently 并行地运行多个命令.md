# 1.3.7 concurrently 并行地运行多个命令

## Install

The tool is written in Node.js, but you can use it to run **any** commands.

```bash
npm install -g concurrently
```

or if you are using it from npm scripts:

```bash
npm install concurrently --save
```

## Usage

Remember to surround separate commands with quotes:
```bash
concurrently "command1 arg" "command2 arg"
```

Otherwise **concurrently** would try to run 4 separate commands:
`command1`, `arg`, `command2`, `arg`.

In package.json, escape quotes:

```bash
"start": "concurrently \"command1 arg\" \"command2 arg\""
```

NPM run commands can be shortened:

```bash
concurrently "npm:watch-js" "npm:watch-css" "npm:watch-node"

# Equivalent to:
concurrently -n watch-js,watch-css,watch-node "npm run watch-js" "npm run watch-css" "npm run watch-node"
```
